📌 Overview

- This guide walks through setting up an AWS system where:

- Files uploaded to an S3 bucket trigger an AWS Lambda function.

- Lambda copies the file to a backup S3 bucket.

- Lambda sends an SNS notification about the file upload.

📂 Required AWS Services

- Amazon S3 (Source & Backup Buckets)

- AWS Lambda (Processes the S3 Event)

- Amazon SNS (Sends notifications)

- AWS IAM (Manages permissions)

STEPS:

🔹 Step 1: Create an S3 Source Bucket

Go to the AWS Management Console → S3.

Click "Create Bucket".

Set Bucket Name: <SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME> (e.g., my-source-bucket).

Select a region and keep other settings default.

Click "Create Bucket".

🔹 Step 2: Create an S3 Backup Bucket

Follow the same steps as above.

Set Bucket Name: <BACKUP_BUCKET_NAME> (e.g., my-backup-bucket).

Ensure it’s in the same region as the source bucket.

🔹 Step 3: Create an SNS Topic

Go to AWS Console → SNS.

Click "Create Topic" → Choose Standard.

Set Name: <SNS_TOPIC_NAME> (e.g., S3UploadNotifications).

Click "Create Topic" and copy the Topic ARN.

Subscribe an Email to SNS

Click "Create Subscription".

Select Protocol: Email.

Enter your Email Address → Click Create Subscription.

Check your email and confirm the subscription.

🔹 Step 4: Attach SNS Policy for S3 Access

In the SNS Console, go to Topics → Select <SNS_TOPIC_NAME>.

Click Edit Access Policy → Add this JSON policy:

📄 File: sns-policy.json

Save changes.

.

🔹 Step 5: Create an IAM Role for Lambda

Go to AWS Console → IAM → Roles.

Click "Create Role".

Choose AWS Service → Lambda.

Attach AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole.

Attach Custom Policy (for S3 & SNS access):

📄 File: iam-policy.json

🔹 Step 6: Create AWS Lambda Function

Go to AWS Console → Lambda.

Click "Create Function" → Select Author from Scratch.

Set Function Name: S3EventHandler.

Choose Runtime: Python 3.x.

Under Permissions, select Use an Existing Role → Choose LambdaS3SNSRole.

Click Create Function.

🔹 Step 7: Add Python Code to Lambda

📄 File: lambda_function.py

🔹 Step 8: Configure S3 Event Notification

Go to S3 Console → Select <SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME>.

Click "Properties" → Scroll to Event Notifications.

Click "Create Event Notification".

Name it S3ToLambdaTrigger.

Event Type: All object create events.

Destination: Select Lambda Function → Choose S3EventHandler.

Click Save Changes.

✅ Testing the Setup

Upload a file to <SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME>.

Check Lambda logs (AWS Console → Lambda → Monitor → View Logs in CloudWatch).

Verify the file was copied to <BACKUP_BUCKET_NAME>.

Check SNS email notification.

🎯 Summary of Project Workflow

1️.User uploads a file to S3 → 2️. S3 triggers Lambda → 3️. Lambda copies the file to backup bucket → 4️. Lambda sends SNS notification → 5️. SNS notifies subscribers.

🚀 Now your system is automated and secure!
